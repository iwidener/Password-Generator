AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN that a user needs a new and secure password
WHEN prompted for password criteria 
THEN a password is generated.

The user will be prompted to choose the length of password between 8 and 128 characters in the input window. 
By clicking a button "Generate Password", the password will be generated and shown in the display. 
The following character types are included into criteria for each generated password:
* Special characters
* Numeric characters 
* Lowercase characters
* Uppercase characters

The user also has an option to click a button "Copy to Clipboard" and to copy the password to the clipboard.

It is a responsive application that can be used on the devices of different sizes.
